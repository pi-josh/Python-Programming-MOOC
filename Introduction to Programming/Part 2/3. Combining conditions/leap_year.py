Programming exercise:
Leap year

Generally, any year that is divisible by four is a leap year.
However, if the year is additionally divisible by 100, it is a
leap year only if it also divisible by 400.

Please write a program which asks the user for a year, and then
prints out whether that year is a leap year or not.

Some examples:

Sample output
Please type in a year: 2011
That year is not a leap year.

Sample output
Please type in a year: 2020
That year is a leap year.

Sample output
Please type in a year: 1800
That year is not a leap year.
"""
year = int(input("Please type in a year: "))

if year % 4 != 0:
    print("That year is not a leap year.")
elif year % 100 != 0:
    print("That year is a leap year.")
elif year % 400 != 0:
    print("That year is not a leap year.")
else:
    print("That year is a leap year.")
